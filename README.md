# Causal-Inference
Code for my research in causal inference studies


My research involves using new machine learning predictive methods to measure treatment effects by predicting counterfactuals.  This code currently in this repository is of 
simulations simulating no confounding and confounding datasets and looks at how the machine learning predictive method works in a simulated environment.  This work is published 
in a pre-print on Arxiv.  The paper is called Predicting treatment effects in observational studies using machine learning methods - a simulation study.
